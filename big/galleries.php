	<p>Images are used on virtually all websites in various ways: a simple background image, a logo, or a slideshow of that last vacation. At the beginning of the internet days, image galleries were not seen much, mostly static pictures. Today's developers can use galleries to display images and videos that are easy to navigate and can have cool transitional effects such as sliding, fading, flipping, and so on. Creating the gallery is no longer the most challenging part of displaying images; it's deciding which method to use for creating the image galleries.
</p>
	<p>Creating an image gallery can be done in several ways. These include Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), jQuery, a combination of those or jQuery plugins.
</p>
	<p>There is a multitude of possible galleries. There are over twenty types of galleries (staff). Some of these examples include masonry, sliding, fullscreen, rotating spiral image gallery, 3D rotating image gallery, 3D cube, and so much more. Most people, though, often think of sliding galleries.
</p>
	<p>Sliding galleries is probably the most popular. It's an endless-looping carousel of images that must be the same size. This gallery type can be created with just CSS (staff) or a jQuery slider plugin (Agarwal). Masonry style galleries are a little different. Think of pintterest.com (Nimesh). Masonry images of various sizes can be accommodated and are displayed in a grid layout using CSS or a jQuuery Masonry plugin.
</p>
	<p>It might be tempting to choose the most eye-catching gallery for a website. After all, it will only make the website even more beautiful. However, if the gallery is unusable or unavailable to a user because their web browser isn't supported or takes too long to load, what good is it? There are hundreds of plugins are available (Ivanos), and not all of them are cross-device or cross-browsers compatible.  No matter how amazing the gallery looks, it's of no use unless the user can see it.
